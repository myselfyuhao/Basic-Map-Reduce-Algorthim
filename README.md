# Basic-Map-Reduce-Algorthim
To help beginners understand the Map-reduce framwork, I put some basic 
map-reduce algorthims into this repository.

Basic algorthims include document statistic, operation for database and Matrix maninupalation, etc.
Advanced algorthims include graph algorthim, machine learning algorthim, etc.
